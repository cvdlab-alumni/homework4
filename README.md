```
Note: camera up vector on z axis.

alpha: [0, 2*PI] - rotate on z axis
beta: [0, PI/2] - rotate on x axis
gamma: [0, PI/2] - rotate on x axis
delta: [0, 2*PI] - rotate on z axis
epsilon: [0, PI/2] - rotate on x axis
switch: on/off
x: x position on the base plane
y: y position on the base plane

## Note

You should select z-axis as camera up vector. In other case rotation axes will not correspond to the provided ones.

## Caveat

The homework is **strictly personal**, and must be worked out by a single student. Violations will be persecuted :o)
